# Impracticle-hacathon-project


## Inspiration
The inspiration is from the flipkart.com

## What it does
We can buy some cook furniture and plywoods for our house and office,

## How we built it
Our web app was built using css, bootstrap, html and canva.

## Challenges we ran into
Living in different areas, it was a little difficult to work together. There were many network issues as well. The hackathon was power packed with all the coding and workshops, so we felt a little short on time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing this website while managing college curriculum. Coordinating and working together with unknown people was a little difficult but we all made it together and are happy with the outcome!

## What we learned
The most important thing we learnt was to coordinate well enough to keep the deadline. Asking for help is normal and everyone is there to help you out. We learnt how to present and include all the details. Also, we all learnt something new in technical aspects, like git, logo designing, etc.

## What's next for Untitled
We have big dreams for the-furniture-world!! In future, we plan to add a chat bot that will be available for guidance 24x7. We would also like to implement payment system for registering for the events. Also, it would be great if we had some celebrities and entrepreneurs to guide others.
